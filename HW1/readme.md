# HW 1 Merge Sort and Insertion Sort Implementations

Both programs are written in C. To compile, use these commands in terminal:
`gcc -g -o mergeSort mergeSort.c`, and
`gcc -g -o insertSort insertSort.c`, respectively. 

Then to run the compiled programs, type in terminal:`./mergeSort` and `./insertSort`

Both programs will read the line-separated lists in 'data.txt', sort, and write the sorted lists into 'merge.txt' and 'insert.txt', respectively. 

MergeSort implementation was adapted to C from the Java implementation from khanacademy's 'implement challenges' on the subject. GeeksForGeeks was also used as reference for the pseudocode.
